# Running this project

Specific instructions about hosting and the backend/frontend specific information are included in the docs and the specific README.md.

Similarily to running other projects, when testing should run `npm install` followed by `npm run dev` to run the frontend. To start the backend should run `npm install` followed by `node server.js`.
